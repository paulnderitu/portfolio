    <h2>Sparks being confused by code</h2>
    <p>Sometimes I cant figure out who sparks is myself. I keep surprising myself with the things that I do, things that I think about in Life, and things that I want to achieve.<p>
     <p>When I am not coding I help out my bro at his photography studio.</p>


     <p>I am a very jovial person and I love living in the moment. I do not like overthinking things that do not have the potential to help future generations in anyway</p>
     <p>I love inventing and creating and thats why I am here; To learn how to create better, and for a cause</p>

    <h2>Why I joined Moringa School</h2>

     <p>I didnt startout in Tech; I actually pursued health sciences back in college, but then I had a business idea.
     </p> This idea required a lot of tech, and the IT guy I approached ask for a little too much. I believe in my idea, and so I had to make sure it didnt go down the drain. Thats why I joined Moring School.</P>
     <p>Life here is quite challenging becasue I have never been to a flipped-classroom before, but I am getting the hang of it as days go by.</p>
     <p>Moringa school offers you an environment that allows you to "learn how to learn."This means that you not only get to learn what you dont know, but you also get to understand and share your knowledge with the world.</p>
     <p>Learning methods that make me believe that I shall change the world with what I learn here include, but not limited to:</p>

     <ul>
       <li>Pair Programming</li>
       <li>Peer reviews</li>
       <li>Lightning talks</li>
       <li>Motivational Speakers</li>
       <li>Flipped Classroom Model<li>
     </ul>
     <p>I believe that Moringa School is changing the lives of many young Kenyans</p>
